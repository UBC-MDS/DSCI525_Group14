The goal of this project is to build and deploy ensemble machine learning models in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia. We are using a large dataset from figshare. Features are outputs of different climate models and the target is the actual rainfall observation.

There are four milestones for this project:

## Milestone 1
Download the data and perform simple EDA

## Milestone 2
Transfer the data into cloud and set up the infrastructure for machine learning model.

## Milestone 3
Build distributed infrastructure (Spark) in cloud and perform a Machine Learning model.


## Milestone 4
TBD
